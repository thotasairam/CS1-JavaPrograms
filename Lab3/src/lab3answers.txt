Q1) By convention, variable names in Java use camel case. Describe what this is:
A) It means that variable names have to be saved like the following exampleOne, example2, exampleThree, and
lastExampleFour.

Q2) What is the difference between the style for a class name and a variable name in Java?
A)  The only difference is class names start with uppercase letter and variable names starts with a lowercase
letter. But, they both are camel case again. Examples are ThisIsClassName and thisIsVariableName.

Q3) What is the standard indentation style for curly braces in Java?
A)  The standard indentation in java is like
    if()
    {
    ....
    } and so on.

Q4) Why is proper indentation important in Java code?
A)  For code readability, and understanding. It is very important to have this practice, so that when
we write programs with lines greater than 100 it will be easy to follow.

Q5) What is the common way to specify a constant value in Java?
A)  Constant value is initialized using the "final" keyword and constant names are all uppercase.
 For example, THIS_IS_CONSTANT is a constant name.

Q6) What unnamed constants are usually acceptable in a Java program?
A)  Numerical constants.

Q7) Which of the bits of code below follow the coding standards? Write the letters of the expressions that
follow the coding standards on your answer sheet.

        a) int a; => true

        b) int A; => false; int a;

        c) public class FunClass => true

        d) public static final int my_const = 3; => false; public static final int MY_CONST = 3;

        e) public int myFunction(int n) => true

        f) public boolean MyBooleanFunction(boolean b) => false; public boolean myBooleanFunction(boolean b)

Q8) If b is of type int, and c is of type double, what are the types of the following expressions? Write the types
of the expressions on your answer sheet.

        a. b % 3 => int

        b. b + 4 => int

        c. b * 2.0 => double

        d. c / 2 => double

        e. b + c => double

Q9) Why would a programmer want to define custom classes instead of just using primitive types such as int and
float?
A) To make use of Java's object oriented programming techniques. It is no use of programming if we can't define
our own custom classes. In my point of view, Building big apps starts from custom classes.

Q10) Between objects and classes, which is more like a template, and which is more like a specific thing?
A)
