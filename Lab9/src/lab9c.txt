As with input, sometimes output cannot be done easily through redirection. For example, if your program needs
to interleave writing to two different files, redirection will not work. In this case, we can use a PrintWriter.
PrintWriter allows you to send output to a file in a way that is very similar to using System.out. Once opened,
you can write to the file using the methods print, println, and printf, just as with System.out. For example:
PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("output.txt"));
writer.println("hello");
